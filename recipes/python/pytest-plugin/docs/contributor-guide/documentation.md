# Writing Documentation

One of the best ways to contribute to this project is by writing documentation.

## Template Project

Feel free to add to the docs whatever you feel necessary without bloating the docs.

More specifically we encourage you to write [jinja2 comments] to the source code:

    {# This is a comment which won't be rendered #}

Please do not hesitate to ask a maintainer for feedback.

## Plugin

The plugin source code can always use more documentation.

Please add doc strings and regular Python comments to the actual plugin code.
